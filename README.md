## Unique Feature
* Unique Feature-01: I added swipper js in my home page banner
* Unique Feature-02: Using AOS in home page main category and also all categories that can see by clicking see books button from home page

## Project Selling line: This Project is about reading book, borrow and return book. After borrowing book. when user return a book it doesn't delete from this page without reloading this page. I fixed that problem. Using AOS from website, animation didn't work properly then I used it from github and when I added CSS and Scripting link without version then It work perfectly.


* My website is a library management website. This is a authentication based website, without home page every pages are protected by private route so only logged in user can visit these routes. There is also a google based authentication system

* Every page has header and footer without login and registration page.
In home page there is a banner, some book categories, and a book reading advantages and contact us form

* When I clicked one category it'll redirect me to a details route where showing 4 books

* when clicked borrow button 1 book will add and one quantity reduced and this book will add to the borrowed booked page. 

* Borrowed booked page have books and each book have a return btn, when clicked on it one book will be reduced. There is also a All books page and there is all books and a search button
